# Vulcmp

**Vulcmp** is a simple *C* and *C++* library to make GPU computing
much easier in your programs. It is a wrapper around the Vulkan library
but it is much more simple to learn and use.

Both the [C library](https://doi6doi.github.io/vytools/C.html) and the [C++ library](https://doi6doi.github.io/vytools/Cpp.html) define a few
types for the work and their corresponding functions (methods).

For fast use, go directly to [Downloads](https://github.com/Doi6doi/vulcmp/releases).

To build manually, read [Install](https://doi6doi.github.io/vytools/Install.html)

This library goes with a free [LICENSE](https://github.com/Doi6doi/vulcmp/blob/main/LICENSE).
